    <h2 id="section-10">10 Example of an FRP system</h2>


    <p>
      We now examine a simple example FRP system.
      The system is designed to support an estate agency (real estate) business.
      It will keep track of properties which are being sold, offers which are made on the properties, decisions made on the offers by the owners, and commission fees earnt by the individual agency employees from their successful sales.
      The example should serve to highlight the declarative nature of the components of an FRP system.
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep things simple, this system operates under some restrictions:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Sales only — no rentals / lettings</li>
      <li>People only have one home, and the owners reside at the property they are selling</li>
      <li>Rooms are perfectly rectangular</li>
      <li>Offer acceptance is binding (i.e. an accepted offer constitutes a sale)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The example will use syntax from a hypothetical FRP infrastructure (which supports not only the relational algebra but also some of the common extensions from <a href="section-8.html#section-8.5" class="section">section 8.5</a>) — typewriter font is used for this.
    </p>


    <h3 id="section-10.1">10.1 User-defined Types</h3>


    <p>
      The example system makes use of a small number of custom types (see <a href="section-9.html#section-9.3" class="section">section 9.3</a>), some of which are just aliases for types provided by the infrastructure:
    </p>

    <pre>
def alias address : string
def alias agent : string
def alias name : string
def alias price : double
def enum roomType : KITCHEN | BATHROOM | LIVING_ROOM
def enum priceBand : LOW | MED | HIGH | PREMIUM
def enum areaCode : CITY | SUBURBAN | RURAL
def enum speedBand : VERY_FAST | FAST | MEDIUM | SLOW | VERY_SLOW
    </pre>


    <h3 id="section-10.2">10.2 Essential State</h3>


    <p>
      The essential state (see <a href="section-9.html#section-9.1.1" class="section">section 9.1.1</a>) consists of the definitions of the <em>types</em> of the base relvars (the types of the attributes are shown in <em>italics</em>).
    </p>

    <pre>
def relvar Property :: {address:<em>address</em> price:<em>price</em>
     photo:<em>filename</em> agent:<em>agent</em> dateRegistered:<em>date</em> }

def relvar Offer :: {address:<em>address</em> price:<em>price</em>
     offerDate:<em>date</em> bidderName:<em>name</em> bidderAddress:<em>address</em> }

def relvar Decision :: {address:<em>address</em> offerDate:<em>date</em>
     bidderName:<em>name</em> bidderAddress:<em>address</em> decisionDate:<em>date</em>
     accepted:<em>bool</em> }

def relvar Room :: {address:<em>address</em> roomName:<em>string</em>
     width:<em>double</em> breadth:<em>double</em> type:<em>roomType</em> }

def relvar Floor :: {address:<em>address</em> roomName:<em>string</em>
     floor:<em>int</em> }

def relvar Commission :: {priceBand:<em>priceBand</em>
     areaCode:<em>areaCode</em> saleSpeed:<em>speedBand</em> commission:<em>double</em> }</pre>

    <p>
      The example makes use of six base relations, most of which are self-explanatory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Property relation stores all properties sold or for-sale.
      As will be seen in <a href="#section-10.3" class="section">section 10.3.3</a>, properties are uniquely identified by their <em>address</em>.
      The <em>price</em> is the desired sale price, the <em>agent</em> is the agency employee responsible for selling the Property, and the <em>dateRegistered</em> is the date that the Property was registered for sale with the agency.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Offer relation records the history of all offers ever made.
      The <em>address</em> represents the Property on which the Offer is being made (by the <em>bidderName</em> who lives at <em>bidderAddress</em>).
      The <em>offerDate</em> attribute records the date when the offer was made, and the <em>offerPrice</em> records the price offered.
      Offers are uniquely identified by an (<em>address</em>, <em>offerDate</em>, <em>bidderName</em>, <em>bidderAddress</em>) combination.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Decision relation records the decisions made by the owner on the Offers that have been made.
      The Offer in question is identified by the (<em>address</em>, <em>offerDate</em>, <em>bidderName</em>, <em>bidderAddress</em>) attributes, and the date and outcome of the decision are recorded by (<em>decisionDate</em> and <em>accepted</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Room relation records information (<em>width</em>, <em>breadth</em>, <em>type</em>) about the rooms that exist at each Property.
      The Property is of course represented by the <em>address</em>.
      One point worthy of note (because it’s slightly artificial) is that an assumption is made that every Room in each Property has a unique (within the scope of that Property) <em>roomName</em>.
      This is necessary because many properties may have more than one room of a given <em>type</em> (and <em>size</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Floor relation records which <em>floor</em> each Room (<em>roomName</em>, <em>address</em>) is on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the Commission relation stores <em>commission</em> fees that can be earned by the agency employees.
      The commission fees are assigned on the basis of sale <em>prices</em> divided into different <em>priceBand</em>s, Property <em>addresses</em> categorized into <em>areaCodes</em> and ratings of the <em>saleSpeed</em>. (The decision has been made to represent commission rates as a base relation — rather than as a function — so that the commission fees can be queried and easily adjusted).
    </p>


    <h3 id="section-10.3">10.3 Essential Logic</h3>


    <p>
      This is the heart of the system (see <a href="section-9.html#section-9.1.2" class="section">section 9.1.2</a>) and corresponds to the “business logic”.
    </p>


    <h4>10.3.1 Functions</h4>


    <p>
      We do not give the actual function definitions here, we just describe their operation informally.
      In reality we would supply the function definitions in terms of some language provided by the infrastructure.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>priceBandForPrice</code></dt>
      <dd>Converts a price into a <em>priceBand</em> (which will be used in the commission calculations)</dd>
      <dt><code>areaCodeForAddress</code></dt>
      <dd>Converts an address into an <em>areaCode</em></dd>
      <dt><code>datesToSpeedBand</code></dt>
      <dd>Converts a pair of dates into a <em>speedBand</em> (reflecting the speed of sale after taking into account the time of year)</dd>
    </dl>


    <h4>10.3.2 Derived Relations</h4>


    <p>
      There are thirteen derived relations in the system.
      These can be very loosely classified as <em>internal</em> or <em>external</em> according to whether their main purpose is simply to facilitate the definition of other derived relations (and constraints) or to provide information to the users.
      We consider the definition and purpose of each in turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an aid to understanding, the types of the derived relations are shown in comments (delimited by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>).
      In reality these types would be derived (or checked) by an infrastructure-provided type inference mechanism.
    </p>


    <h5>Internal</h5>


    <p>
      The ten <em>internal</em> derived relations exist mainly to help with the later definition of the three <em>external</em> ones.
    </p>

    <pre>
/* RoomInfo :: {address:address roomName:string width:double
                breadth:double type:roomType roomSize:double} */
RoomInfo = extend(Room, (roomSize = width*breadth))</pre>

    <p>
      The RoomInfo derived relation simply extends the Room base relation with an extra attribute <em>roomSize</em> which gives the area of each room.
    </p>

    <pre>
/* Acceptance :: {address:address offerDate:date bidderName:name
                  bidderAddress:address decisionDate:date} */
Acceptance = project_away(restrict(Decision | accepted == true),
                          accepted)</pre>

    <p>
      The Acceptance derived relation simply selects the positive entries from the Decision base relation, and then strips away the <em>accepted</em> attribute (the <code>project_away</code> operation is the dual of the <code>project</code> operation — it removes the listed attributes rather than keeping them).
    </p>

    <pre>
/* Rejection :: {address:address offerDate:date bidderName:name
                 bidderAddress:address decisionDate:date} */
Rejection = project_away(restrict(Decision | accepted == false),
                         accepted)</pre>

    <p>
      The Rejection derived relation simply selects the negative decisions and removes the <em>accepted</em> attribute.
    </p>

    <pre>
/* PropertyInfo :: {address:address price:price photo:filename
                    agent:agent dateRegistered:date
                    priceBand:priceBand areaCode:areaCode
                    numberOfRooms:int squareFeet:double} */
PropertyInfo =
extend(Property,
       (priceBand = priceBandForPrice(price)),
       (areaCode = areaCodeForAddress(address)),
       (numberOfRooms = count(restrict(RoomInfo |
                                       address == address))),
       (squareFeet = sum(roomSize, restrict(RoomInfo |
                                            address == address))))</pre>

    <p>
      The PropertyInfo derived relation extends the Property base relation with four new attributes.
      The first — called <em>priceBand</em> — indicates which of the estate agency’s price bands the property is in.
      The price band of the final sale price will affect the commission derived by the agent for selling the property.
      The <em>areaCode</em> attribute indicates the area code, which also affects the commission an agent may earn.
      The <em>numberOfRooms</em> is calculated by counting the number of rooms (actually the number of entries in the RoomInfo derived relation at the corresponding address), and the <em>squareFeet</em> is computed by summing up the relevant <em>roomSizes</em>.
    </p>

    <pre>
/* CurrentOffer :: {address:address offerPrice:price
                    offerDate:date bidderName:name
                    bidderAddress:address} */
CurrentOffer =
summarize(Offer,
          project(Offer, address bidderName bidderAddress),
          quota(offerDate,1))</pre>

    <p>
      The purpose of the CurrentOffer derived relation is to filter out old offers which have been superceded by newer ones (e.g. if the bidder has submitted a revised — higher or lower — offer, then we are no longer interested in older offers they may have made on the same property).
    </p>

    <p>
      The definition summarizes the Offer base relation, taking the most recent (i.e. the single greatest <em>offerDate</em>) offer made by each bidder on a property (i.e. per unique <em>address</em>, <em>bidderName</em>, <em>bidderAddress</em> combination).
      Because both <em>bidderName</em> and <em>bidderAddress</em> are included, the system supports the (admittedly unusual) possibility of different people living in the same place (<em>bidderAddress</em>) submitting different offers on the same property (<em>address</em>).
    </p>

    <pre>
/* RawSales :: {address:address offerPrice:price
                decisionDate:date agent:agent
                dateRegistered:date} */
RawSales =
project_away(join(Acceptance,
                  join(CurrentOffer,
                       project(Property, address agent
                                         dateRegistered))),
             offerDate bidderName bidderAddress)</pre>

    <p>
      For the purposes of this example, sales are seen as corresponding directly to accepted offers.
      As a result the definition of the RawSales relation is in terms of the Acceptance relation.
      These accepted offers are augmented (joined) with the CurrentOffer information (which includes the agreed <em>offerPrice</em>) and with information (<em>agent</em>, <em>dateRegistered</em>) from the Property relation.
    </p>

    <pre>
/* SoldProperty :: {address:address} */
SoldProperty = project(RawSales, address)</pre>

    <p>
      The SoldProperty relation simply contains the <em>address</em> of all Properties on which a sale has been agreed (i.e. the properties in the RawSales relation).
    </p>

    <pre>
/* UnsoldProperty :: {address:address} */
UnsoldProperty = minus(project(Property, address), SoldProperty)</pre>

    <p>
      The UnsoldProperty is obviously just the Property which is not SoldProperty (i.e. all Property addresses minus the SoldProperty addresses).
    </p>

    <pre>
/* SalesInfo :: {address:address agent:agent areaCode:areaCode
                 saleSpeed:speedBand priceBand:priceBand} */
SalesInfo =
project(extend(RawSales,
               (areaCode = areaCodeForAddress(address)),
               (saleSpeed = datesToSpeedBand(dateRegistered,
                                             decisionDate)),
               (priceBand = priceBandForPrice(offerPrice))),
             address agent areaCode saleSpeed priceBand)</pre>

    <p>
      The SalesInfo relation is based on the RawSales relation, but extends it with <em>areaCode</em>, <em>saleSpeed</em> and <em>priceBand</em> information by calling the three relevant functions.
    </p>

    <pre>
/* SalesCommissions :: {address:address agent:agent
                        commission:double} */
SalesCommissions =
project(join(SalesInfo, Commission),
        address agent commission)</pre>

    <p>
      The SalesCommissions which are due to the agents are derived simply by joining together the SalesInfo with the Commission base relation.
      This gives the amount of <em>commission</em> due to each <em>agent</em> on each Property (represented by <em>address</em>).
    </p>


    <h5>External</h5>


    <p>
      Having now defined all the <em>internal</em> derived relations, we are now in a position to define the <em>external</em> derived relations — these are the ones which will be of most direct interest to the users of the system.
    </p>

    <pre>
/* OpenOffers :: {address:address offerPrice:price
                  offerDate:date bidderName:name
                  bidderAddress:address} */
OpenOffers =
join(CurrentOffer,
     minus(project_away(CurrentOffer, offerPrice),
           project_away(Decision, accepted decisionDate)))</pre>

    <p>
      The OpenOffers relation gives details of the CurrentOffers on which the owner has not yet made a Decision.
      This is calculated by joining the CurrentOffer information (which includes <em>offerPrice</em>) with those CurrentOffers (excluding the price information) that do not have corresponding Decisions. <code>project_away</code> is used here because <code>minus</code> requires its arguments to be of the same type.
    </p>

    <pre>
/* PropertyForWebSite :: {address:address price:price
                          photo:filename numberOfRooms:int
                          squareFeet:double} */
PropertyForWebSite = project( join(UnsoldProperty, PropertyInfo),
                              address price photo
                              numberOfRooms squareFeet )</pre>

    <p>
      The business wants to display the information from PropertyInfo on their external website.
      However, they only want to show unsold property (this is achieved simply by a <code>join</code>), and they only want to show a subset of the attributes (this is achieved with a <code>project</code>).
    </p>

    <pre>
/* CommissionDue :: {agent:agent totalCommission:double} */
CommissionDue =
project(summarize(SalesCommissions,
                  project(SalesCommissions, agent),
                  totalCommission = sum(commission)),
        agent totalCommission)</pre>

    <p>
      Finally, the total commission due to each agent is calculated by simply summing up the <em>commission</em> attribute of the SalesCommissions relation on a per <em>agent</em> basis to give the <em>totalCommission</em> attribute.
    </p>


    <h4>10.3.3 Integrity</h4>


    <p>
      Integrity constraints are given in the form of relational algebra or relational calculus expressions.
      As already noted, our hypothetical FRP infrastructure provides common relational algebra extensions (see <a href="section-8.html#section-8.5" class="section">section 8.5</a>).
      It also provides special syntax for <em>candidate</em> and <em>foreign</em> key constraints. (This syntax is effectively just a shorthand for the underlying algebra or calculus expression).
    </p>

    <p>
      We consider the standard (key) constraints first:
    </p>

    <pre>
candidate key Property = (address)
candidate key Offer = (address, offerDate,
                       bidderName, bidderAddress)
candidate key Decision = (address, offerDate,
                          bidderName, bidderAddress)
candidate key Room = (address, roomName)
candidate key Floor = (address, roomName)
candidate key Commision = (priceBand, areaCode, saleSpeed)

foreign key Offer (address) in Property
foreign key Decision (address, offerDate,
                      bidderName, bidderAddress) in Offer
foreign key Room (address) in Property
foreign key Floor (address) in Property</pre>

    <p>
      There are also some slightly more interesting, domain-specific constraints.
      The first insists that all properties must have at least one room:
    </p>

    <pre>
count(restrict(PropertyInfo | numberOfRooms &lt; 1)) == 0</pre>

    <p>
      The next ensures that people cannot submit bids on their own property (owners are assumed to be residing at the property they are selling):
    </p>

    <pre>
count(restrict(Offer | bidderAddress == address)) == 0</pre>

    <p>
      This constraint prohibits the submission of any Offers on a property (<em>address</em>) after a sale has happened (i.e. after an Acceptance has occurred for the <em>address</em>):
    </p>

    <pre>
count(restrict(join(Offer,
                    project(Acceptance, address decisionDate))
               | offerDate &gt; decisionDate)) == 0</pre>

    <p>
      The next constraint ensures that there are never more than 50 properties advertised on the website in the <code>PREMIUM</code> price band:
    </p>

    <pre>
count(restrict(extend(PropertyForWebSite,
                      (priceBand = priceBandForPrice(price)))
               | priceBand == PREMIUM)) &lt; 50</pre>

    <p>
      This is an interesting constraint because it depends (directly as it happens) on a user-defined function (<code>priceBandForPrice</code>).
      One implication of this is that changes to function definitions (as well as changes to <em>essential state</em>) could — if unchecked — cause the system to violate its constraints.
      No FRP infrastructure can allow this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately there are two straightforward approaches to solving this.
      The first is that the infrastructure could treat function definitions as data (essential state) and apply the same kind of modification checks.
      The alternative is that it could refuse to run a system with a new function version which causes existing data to be considered invalid.
      In this latter case manual state changes would be required to restore integrity and to allow the system to become operational again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, no single bidder can submit more than 10 offers (over time) on a single Property.
      This constraint works by first computing the number of offers made by each bidder (<em>bidderName</em>, <em>bidderAddress</em>) on each Property (<em>address</em>), and ensuring that this is never more than 10:
    </p>

    <pre>
count(restrict(summarize(Offer,
                         project(Offer, address bidderName
                                        bidderAddress),
                         numberOfOffers = count())
               | numberOfOffers &gt; 10)) == 0</pre>

    <p>
      Once the system is deployed, the FRP infrastructure will reject any state modification attempts which would violate any of these integrity constraints.
    </p>


    <h3 id="section-10.4">10.4 Accidental State and Control</h3>


    <p>
      The <em>accidental state and control</em> component of an FRP system consists solely of a set of declarations which represent performance hints for the infrastructure (see <a href="section-9.html#section-9.1.3" class="section">section 9.1.3</a>).
      In this example the <em>accidental state and control</em> is a set of three hint declarations.
    </p>

    <pre>declare store PropertyInfo</pre>

    <p>
      This declaration is simply a hint to the infrastructure to request that the PropertyInfo derived relation is actually stored (i.e. cached) rather than continually recalculated.
    </p>

    <pre>declare store shared Room Floor</pre>

    <p>
      This hint instructs the infrastructure to <em>denormalize</em> the Room and Floor relations into a single shared storage structure.
      (Note that because we are able to express this as part of the <em>accidental state and control</em> we have not been forced to compromise the <em>essential</em> parts of our system which still treat Room and Floor separately).
    </p>

    <pre>declare store separate Property (photo)</pre>

    <p>
      This hint instructs the infrastructure to store the <em>photo</em> attribute of the Property relation separately from its other attributes (because it is not frequently used).
    </p>

    <p>
      These three hints have all focused on <em>state</em> (PropertyInfo is <em>accidental state</em>, and the other two declarations are concerned with <em>accidental</em> aspects <em>of</em> state).
      Larger systems would probably also include <em>accidental control</em> specifications for performance reasons.
    </p>


    <h3 id="section-10.5">10.5 Other</h3>


    <p>
      The <em>feeders</em> and <em>observers</em> for this system would be fairly simple — <em>feeding</em> user input into Decisions, Offers etc., and directly <em>observing</em> and displaying the various derived relations as output (e.g. OpenOffers, PropertyForWebSite and CommisionDue).
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of this it is reasonable to expect that the <em>feeders</em> and <em>observers</em> would require no custom coding at all, but could instead be specified in a completely declarative fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      One extension which might require a custom <em>observer</em> would be a requirement to connect CommissionDue into an external payroll system.
    </p>
