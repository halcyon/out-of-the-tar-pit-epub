    <h2 id="section-3">3 Approaches to Understanding</h2>
    <article>
    <p>
      We argued above that the danger of complexity came from its impact on our attempts to <em>understand</em> a system.
      Because of this, it is helpful to consider the mechanisms that are commonly used to try to understand systems.
      We can then later consider the impact that potential causes of complexity have on these approaches.
      There are two widely-used approaches to understanding systems (or components of systems):
    </p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Testing</dt>
      <dd>
        This is attempting to understand a system from the outside — as a “black box”.
        Conclusions about the system are drawn on the basis of observations about how it behaves in certain specific situations.
        Testing may be performed either by human or by machine.
        The former is more common for whole-system testing, the latter more common for individual component testing.
      </dd>

      <dt>Informal Reasoning</dt>
      <dd>
        This is attempting to understand the system by examining it from the inside.
        The hope is that by using the extra information available, a more accurate understanding can be gained.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>
      Of the two informal reasoning is the most important by far.
      This is because — as we shall see below — there are inherent limits to what can be achieved by testing, and because informal reasoning (by virtue of being an inherent part of the development process) is <em>always</em> used.
      The other justification is that improvements in informal reasoning will lead to <em>less errors being created</em> whilst all that improvements in testing can do is to lead to <em>more errors being detected</em>.
      As Dijkstra said in his Turing award speech [<a href="references.html#Dij72" class="reference">Dij72</a>, EWD340]:
      <blockquote>
        “Those who want really reliable software will discover that they must find means of avoiding the majority of bugs to start with.”
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      and as O’Keefe (who also stressed the importance of “<em>understanding your problem</em>” and that “<em>Elegance is not optional</em>”) said [<a href="references.html#OK90" class="reference">O’K90</a>]:
      <blockquote>
        “Our response to mistakes should be to look for ways that we can avoid making them, not to blame the nature of things.”
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The key problem with testing is that a test (of any kind) that uses one particular set of inputs tells you <em>nothing at all</em> about the behaviour of the system or component when it is given a different set of inputs.
      The huge number of different possible inputs usually rules out the possibility of testing them all, hence the unavoidable concern with testing will always be — <em>have you performed the </em>right<em> tests</em>?.
      The only certain answer you will ever get to this question is an answer in the negative — when the system breaks.  Again, as Dijkstra observed [<a href="references.html#Dij71" class="reference">Dij71</a>, EWD303]:
      <blockquote>
        “testing is hopelessly inadequate.…(it) can be used very effectively to show the presence of bugs but never to show their absence.”
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We agree with Dijkstra. <em>Rely</em> on testing at your peril.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is <em>not</em> to say that testing has no use.
      The bottom line is that all ways of attempting to understand a system have their limitations (and this includes both <em>informal reasoning</em> — which is limited in scope, imprecise and hence prone to error — as well as <em>formal reasoning</em> — which is dependent upon the accuracy of a specification).
      Because of these limitations it may often be prudent to employ both testing <em>and</em> reasoning together.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is precisely <em>because</em> of the limitations of all these approaches that <em>simplicity</em> is vital.
      When considered next to testing and reasoning, simplicity is more important than either.
      Given a stark choice between investment in testing and investment in simplicity, the latter may often be the better choice because it will facilitate <em>all</em> future attempts to understand the system — attempts of any kind.
