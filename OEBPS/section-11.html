      FRP draws some influence from the ideas of [<a href="references.html#DD00" class="reference">DD00</a>].
      In contrast with this work however, FRP is aimed at general purpose, large-scale <em>application</em> programming.  Additionally FRP focuses on a <em>separate</em>, <em>functional</em>, sub-language and has different ideas about the use of types.
      Finally the <em>accidental</em> component of FRP has a broader range than the physical / logical mapping of traditional DBMSs.

      There are also some similarities to Backusâ€™ Applicative State Transition systems [<a href="references.html#Bac78" class="reference">Bac78</a>], and to the Aldat project at McGill [<a href="references.html#Mer85" class="reference">Mer85</a>] which investigated general purpose applications of relational algebra.
