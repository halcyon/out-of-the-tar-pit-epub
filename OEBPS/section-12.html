    <article>

    <p>
      We have argued that <em>complexity</em> causes more problems in large software systems than anything else.
      We have also argued that it <em>can</em> be tamed — but only through a concerted effort to <em>avoid</em> it where possible, and to <em>separate</em> it where not.
      Specifically we have argued that a system can usefully be <em>separated</em> into three main parts: the <em>essential state</em>, the <em>essential logic</em>, and the <em>accidental state and control</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that taking these principles and applying them to the top level of a system design — effectively using different specialised <em>languages</em> for the different components — can offer more in terms simplicity than can the unstructured adoption of any single general language (be it imperative, logic or functional).
      In making this argument we briefly surveyed each of the common programming paradigms, paying some attention to the weaknesses of object-orientation as a particular example of an imperative approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      In cases (such as existing large systems) where this <em>separation</em> cannot be directly applied we believe the focus should be on avoiding state, avoiding explicit control where possible, and striving at all costs to <em>get rid of code</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what is the way out of the tar pit? What is the silver bullet? … it may not be FRP, but we believe there can be no doubt that it is <em>simplicity</em>.
