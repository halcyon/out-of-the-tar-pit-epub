    <p class="abstract">
      Complexity is the single major difficulty in the successful development of large-scale software systems.
      Following Brooks we distinguish <em>accidental</em> from <em>essential</em> difficulty, but disagree with his premise that most complexity remaining in contemporary systems is essential.
      We identify common causes of complexity and discuss general approaches which can be taken to eliminate them where they are accidental in nature.
      To make things more concrete we then give an outline for a potential complexity-minimizing approach based on <em>functional programming</em> and <em>Coddâ€™s relational model of data.</em></p>
