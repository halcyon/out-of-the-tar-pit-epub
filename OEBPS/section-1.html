    <h2 id="section-1">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      The “software crisis” was first identified in 1968 [<a href="references.html#NR69" class="reference">NR69</a>] and in the intervening decades has deepened rather than abated.
      The biggest problem in the development and maintenance of large-scale software systems is complexity — large systems are hard to understand.
      We believe that the major contributor to this complexity in many systems is the handling of <em>state</em> and the burden that this adds when trying to analyse and reason about the system.
      Other closely related contributors are <em>code volume</em>, and explicit concern with the <em>flow of control</em> through the system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The classical ways to approach the difficulty of state include object-oriented programming which tightly couples state together with related behaviour, and functional programming which — in its pure form — eschews state and side-effects all together.
      These approaches each suffer from various (and differing) problems when applied to traditional large-scale systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      We argue that it is possible to take useful ideas from both and that — when combined with some ideas from the relational database world — this approach offers significant potential for simplifying the construction of large-scale software systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The paper is divided into two halves.
      In the first half we focus on complexity.
      In <a href="section-2.html" class="section">section 2</a> we look at complexity in general and justify our assertion that it is at the root of the crisis, then we look at how we currently attempt to understand systems in <a href="section-3.html" class="section">section 3</a>.
      In <a href="section-4.html" class="section">section 4</a> we look at the causes of complexity (i.e. things which make understanding difficult) before discussing the classical approaches to managing these complexity causes in <a href="section-5.html" class="section">section 5</a>.
      In <a href="section-6.html" class="section">section 6</a> we define what we mean by “accidental” and “essential” and then in <a href="section-7.html" class="section">section 7</a> we give recommendations for alternative ways of addressing the causes of complexity — with an emphasis on avoidance of the problems rather than coping with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the second half of the paper we consider in more detail a possible approach that follows our recommended strategy.
      We start with a review of the relational model in <a href="section-8.html" class="section">section 8</a> and give an overview of the potential approach in <a href="section-9.html#section-9" class="section">section 9</a>.
      In <a href="section-10.html#section-10" class="section">section 10</a> we give a brief example of how the approach might be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally we contrast our approach with others in <a href="section-11.html#section-11" class="section">section 11</a> and then give conclusions in <a href="section-12.html#section-12" class="section">section 12</a>.
